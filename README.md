will write pseudocode for the crack_code method here. will also include gameplay info.

current plan:

1) refactor for readability.
  A) Go thru each line and try and make your code shorter.
  B) Make your code more modular. rn there's a lot of dependency between classes. Do I accomplish this by joining classes together? Sorting them more effectively?

2) add typo handling.

3) possibility: add detailed explanation in readme for how the code works

note: look up "design patterns" from Alex's link.
